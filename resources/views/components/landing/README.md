## Route Configuration

The home route has been updated to return a Blade view instead of Inertia:

```php
Route::get('/', function () {
    $courses = \App\Models\Course::with('user')
        ->where('published', true)
        ->latest()
        ->get();

    return view('welcome', [
        'courses' => $courses
    ]);
})->name('home');
```

## Dashboard Area

The dashboard area (authenticated users) remains in React/Inertia for:
- Interactive course management
- Real-time updates
- Complex user interactions
- Dynamic content management

## Benefits of This Structure

2. **⚡ Performance**: Faster initial page load without JavaScript
3. **📱 Responsive**: Works perfectly on all devices
4. **🌙 Dark Mode**: Full dark mode support throughout
5. **♿ Accessible**: Proper semantic HTML and ARIA labels
6. **🔧 Maintainable**: Clean, modular Blade components
7. **🎯 Conversion Focused**: Optimized for landing page conversions
8. **🔄 Hybrid Approach**: Best of both worlds - Blade for SEO, React for interactivity

## Customization

Each component is designed to be easily customizable:
- Colors and gradients can be modified in Tailwind classes
- Content can be updated in the component files
- Layouts can be adjusted by modifying the grid/flex classes
- New features can be added by extending the existing components

## Migration Notes

- The React components are preserved in `resources/js/components/landing/` for reference
- The main `welcome.tsx` React page is kept for potential future use
- All functionality is maintained with improved SEO performance
- Dashboard and authenticated areas remain in React/Inertia
